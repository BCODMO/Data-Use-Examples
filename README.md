# Data-Use-Examples

This repository accumulates BCO-DMO data usage examples.  Many were generated as part of broader courses and workshops listed below.

# Lessons

The following lessons were created by BCO-DMO data managers and use examples of how to access and use BCO-DMO data.

### Lesson description
Data reuse saves time and accelerates the pace of scientific discovery. By making your data open and available to others, you make it possible for future researchers to answer questions that havenâ€™t yet been asked. But how do you actually reuse the data that you put in repositories?

This is a 4 hour workshop tailored to the ocean sciences. We aim to teach the basics of data reuse using ERDDAP servers maintained by ocean science-specific repositories and programs. The processing environment where the data will be pulled in to is Python, but other programs such as R and Matlab can make use of the same technology.
